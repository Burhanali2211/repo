## 🛠 Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup
First, you need to create the AI settings table in your Supabase database:

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Run the SQL script provided in the setup page (`/setup-ai-settings`)
4. The script creates:
   - `ai_settings` table with proper schema
   - Row Level Security policies
   - Automatic timestamp triggers

### 2. AI Provider Configuration
1. Navigate to Dashboard → AI Integration
2. Go to the Configuration tab
3. Select your preferred AI provider:
   - **OpenAI**: Requires API key starting with `sk-`
   - **Claude**: Requires API key starting with `sk-ant-`
   - **Google Gemini**: Requires valid Google API key
4. Enter your API key (it will be encrypted automatically)
5. Choose an appropriate model for your use case
6. Test the connection to verify setup

### 3. Feature Activation
1. Enable AI features in the Configuration tab
2. Go to the Features tab to configure individual capabilities:
   - **AI Analytics**: Intelligent data insights
   - **Smart Recommendations**: Improvement suggestions
   - **Natural Language Queries**: Chat with your data
   - **Intelligent Alerts**: Anomaly detection
   - **Smart Visualizations**: AI-suggested charts

## 🎯 Usage Guide

### AI Analytics
- Automatically analyzes your dashboard data
- Provides insights on traffic patterns, performance issues, and opportunities
- Generates actionable recommendations with priority levels
- Tracks trends and detects anomalies

### Natural Language Queries
- Ask questions in plain English about your data
- Examples:
  - "How is my website performing?"
  - "What are my top traffic sources?"
  - "How can I improve conversions?"
- Get detailed responses with confidence scores
- Follow-up questions suggested automatically

### Smart Recommendations
- AI analyzes your data and suggests improvements
- Categorized by impact and effort required
- Actionable items with clear next steps
- Performance tracking for implemented suggestions

### Intelligent Alerts
- Proactive monitoring of key metrics
- Automatic detection of unusual patterns
- Severity-based alert system
- Customizable thresholds and notifications

## 🔒 Security Features

### API Key Protection
- **Encryption**: All API keys are encrypted before storage
- **Masking**: Keys are masked in the UI for security
- **Validation**: Format validation for different providers
- **Secure Transmission**: Keys never logged or transmitted in plain text

### Data Privacy
- **User Isolation**: Each user's AI settings are completely separate
- **RLS Policies**: Database-level security ensures data protection
- **Minimal Data Sharing**: Only necessary data sent to AI providers
- **Transparent Policies**: Clear information about data usage
